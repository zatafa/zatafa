# 👋 About me

- 🌱 I’m currently following OpenClassrooms training program (Artificial Intelligence Engineer), developed in partnership with Microsoft and Centrale Supelec. I'm learning Data Science, Machine and Deep learning, Cloud computing with Microsoft Azure and and deployment of algorithms into production. Details can be found [here](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/188-ingenieur-ia).

- 👀 I'm really interested in problem solving and decision taking with data ;  my focus is to create, apply and modify algorithms/models to solve challenging business problem.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real world or research experience in data science.
